ðŸ§  Cat-FSL: Hybrid CatBoost-Based Few-Shot Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification






Cat-FSL is a novel hybrid Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework designed to enhance inter-class classification in Hyperspectral Images (HSI) under limited labeled data conditions.
The architecture combines CatBoost-derived global probabilistic features and CNN-based local spectral embeddings using a dual-path design, enabling robust prototype learning and superior class separability.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Dual-Path Architecture:
Combines CatBoost (global dependencies) and CNN (local spectral refinement) for balanced feature representation.

Prototypical Network Fusion:
Merges both feature streams to learn a discriminative metric space and generate stable class prototypes.

Optimal Distortion Search (ODS):
Enhances robustness against spectral distortions and improves generalization.

Comprehensive Sensitivity Analysis:
Evaluates the effects of CatBoost hyperparameters, learning rate, and iteration count using:
